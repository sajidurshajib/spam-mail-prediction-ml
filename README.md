## 📩 Overview

Spam emails are a prevalent issue in today's digital world. This project aims to tackle this problem by developing a machine learning model that can accurately classify emails as spam or ham. The model uses a combination of text mining, feature engineering, and classification algorithm (Logistic Regression) to predict the spam label for a given email.

## 🔠 Installation

To install and run the spam mail prediction model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sajidurshajib/spam-mail-prediction-ml.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd spam-mail-prediction-ml
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 🔼 Usage

1. Prepare your email data by ensuring it is in a suitable format (e.g., a CSV file).
2. Run the `app.py` script to train the spam mail prediction model.
3. And set your mail in ```input_mail``` variable.

## ‼️ Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluating the model is not included in this repository due to its size. However, you can obtain publicly available spam email datasets from various sources, such as the UCI Machine Learning Repository or Kaggle. Make sure to preprocess and format your dataset appropriately before training the model.

## 🎰 Model Training

To train the spam mail prediction model, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your dataset as per the instructions provided in the [Dataset](#dataset) section.
2. Run the `app.py` script:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. The script will preprocess the data, train the model, and save the trained model to disk.

## 🤞 Evaluation

To evaluate the performance of the spam mail prediction model, you can view the percentage:

```bash
python app.py
```

The script will load the trained model, process the evaluation dataset, and generate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
